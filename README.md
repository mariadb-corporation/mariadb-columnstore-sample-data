# Sample ColumnStore Data
## Description 
This simple data set uses the [on time performance](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/homepage.asp) dataset from the *Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)* for US based commercial airline flights. This includes the following 3 tables:

*   **airlines** : Dimension table for airlines (30 records)
*   **airports** : Dimension table for airports (400 records)
*   **flights** : Fact table for airline departure data (38,083,735 records)

## Quick Start
### Clone The Repo
```
git clone https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/mariadb-columnstore-samples.git
cd mariadb-columnstore-samples
```
### Run The Project
```
./run_project
```
This script will:
1. Create sample schemas(s)
2. Download flight data from our public S3 bucket
3. Load into the database
4. Offer you the ability to clone this data to InnoDB for direct comparisions with ColumnStore.

## Sample Queries
The following sample queries are provided in the [queries directory](/queries/):

1.  **1.sql** : Provides a report of flight count, market share percentage, cancelled flights percentage, and diverted flights percentage by airline for 2020.
2.  **2.sql** : Provides a report of the delay types by airline by year.
3.  **3.sql** : Provides a report of the volume and average arrival delay for California based airports by airline in 2020.
4.  **4.sql** : Provides a report of the average and maximum delay by month and hour in the day for bay area airports in 2020.
5.  **5.sql** : Provides a report of the average and maximum delay by day and hour for bay area airports in November 2020.

|ColumnStore           |2GB                  |

## Conclusion

In terms of performance, both storage engines excel in different areas. InnoDB is optimized for transactional workloads, where data is frequently updated or inserted. It uses a write-ahead logging mechanism to ensure that data is always consistent and recoverable in case of a system failure. 

In contrast, ColumnStore is optimized for analytical workloads, where data is read-intensive and queries often involve aggregation and filtering operations. ColumnStore can execute these queries much faster due to its columnar design and vectorized processing.

ColumnStore has the additional benefit of a high speed bulk loader and a smaller disk footprint due to lack of indexes and the high compression ratio of the data on disk.
